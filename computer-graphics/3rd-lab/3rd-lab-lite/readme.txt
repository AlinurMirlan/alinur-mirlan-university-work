Introduction
Greetings, User. This application lets you detect pedestrians on images.

User Manual
You can get a premade classifier (the best one I could produce) at results/models/model.zip.
See the results the premade classifier at results/results.idl.

* Train and save your own classifier:
	Provide a selection of images and the coordinates of the pedestrians on the images by pressing the 'images directory' and 'locations file' buttons under the 'Training' label respectively.
	Save the classifier via the 'save classifier' button.
* Test a selection of images with your classifier:
	Turn in the folder with your images and the classifier to test with by pushing the 'images directory' and 'classifier file' buttons under the 'Testing' label respectively.
	You may also opt to display the chosen classifier's statistics by further providing the coordinates of the pedestrians (if any) on the images through the 'locations file' button that's after the 'Show statistics' label.
	Save detected pedestrians' locations by using the 'save locations' button.
* Detect pedestrians on an individual image:
	Choose the model classifier to work with by pushing the 'Choose model' button
	Select an image to test by pressing the 'Detect pedestrian' button, wait a few moments and see the results. Top right block shows the original image, while the bottom block the processed one.
